# BlackLine Scanner (Ultimate)

## Overview
**BlackLine Scanner (Ultimate)** is an advanced tool designed for web developers, security researchers, and enthusiasts to extract and analyze various resources, URLs, scripts, images, sensitive form fields, cookies, and check for common vulnerabilities on a webpage. This script provides a user-friendly interface to view and interact with the resources found on the current page.

## Features
- **URL Extraction**: Scans the page for all links, resources, and endpoints.
- **Script Detection**: Identifies external and inline scripts on the page.
- **Image Collection**: Gathers all images (URLs) from the page.
- **Sensitive Form Fields Detection**: Identifies potential sensitive fields such as password, email, and text inputs.
- **Cookie Extraction**: Displays the cookies in the page for security analysis.
- **Basic Vulnerability Check**: Highlights common issues like missing autocomplete attributes, inline scripts, and cookies missing the `HttpOnly` flag.

## Installation
No installation is required for the script. It can be executed directly in the browser console as a bookmarklet.

### How to Use
1. Copy the script code (Bookmarkscript_By_Dev.txt) provided below.
2. Create a new bookmark in your browser.
3. In the URL field of the bookmark, paste the copied script.
4. Navigate to any webpage, click the bookmarklet, and the tool will scan the page and display the results.

### Bookmarklet Code
- [Bookmarkscript](./Bookmarkscript_By_Dev.txt)

To use the BlackLine Scanner, simply copy the content from `Bookmarkscript_By_Dev.txt` and paste it into your bookmark URL field.


### Areas for Improvement:
- Enhance the **vulnerability check** with additional checks for common web security issues.
- Improve the **UI/UX** for better user interaction and experience.
- Add more **customization options** for scanning different types of resources.
